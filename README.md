# mcav_shuffle

This project looks at the effects of symbiont shuffling and heat stress on the transcriptome and microbiome of the coral *Montastraea cavernosa*. Replicate cores of 9 colonies were exposed to an initial thermal bleaching treatment and then recovered at ambient temperature, in order to promote a change in the Symbiodiniaceae community from *Cladocopium* to *Durusdinium* dominance. Subsequently, half of these cores were re-exposed to thermal stress, and all cores were sampled for analysis of gene expression (by tag-based RNAseq) and bacterial community strucuture (by 16S metabarcoding).

The tag-based RNAseq and gene ontology enrichment analyses conducted here are based on code from Misha Matz's [tag-based_RNAseq](http://github.com/z0on/tag-based_RNAseq) and [GO_MWU](http://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU) repositories, which have been modified and internalized for this specific project.
