# Add tagseq scripts in this repository to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$PWD/code/tagseq"

# Change directory to tagseq raw data
cd data/tagseq/raw

# Expand raq tagseq data fastq.gz files to fastq
gunzip -k *.gz

# Move fastq files to intermediate directory for processing
mv *.fastq ../intermediate

# Change directory to processed tagseq data
cd ../intermediate

# Concatenate reads from samples split across multiple files from different lanes
ngs_concat.pl '^' '(.+)_S'

# Delete all original .fastq files (no longer needed after concatenation to new .fq files)
rm *.fastq

## creating and launching the cleaning process for all files in the same time:
tagseq_trim_launch.pl '\.fq$' > clean

## now execute all commands written to file 'clean', preferably in parallel (see Note in the beginning of this walkthrough)
parallel :::: clean

# Change directory to mcav genome
cd ../../genome

## Format reference genome:
bowtie2-build Mcavernosa.maker.transcripts.fasta Mcavernosa.maker.transcripts.fasta

# Change directory to intermediate data folder
cd ../tagseq/intermediate

## mapping reads to genome
tagseq_bowtie2map.pl "trim$" ../../genome/Mcavernosa.maker.transcripts.fasta > maps

# execute all the commands in 'maps', record screen output in file called maps.out
parallel :::: maps &> maps.out

## counting hits per gene:
samcount_launch_bt2.pl '\.sam$' ../../genome/Mcav_transcript_geneID.txt > sc

# execute all commands in 'sc' file
parallel :::: sc

## assembling all counts into a single table:
expression_compiler.pl *.sam.counts > ../processed/counts_newpars.txt



# count raw reads for all samples
rm rawreads.txt
parallel wc -l ::: *.fq >> rawreads.txt
awk '{ print $2, ($1/4) }' rawreads.txt > rawreads2.txt

# count post-QC reads for all samples
rm postQCreads.txt
parallel wc -l ::: *.trim >> postQCreads.txt
awk '{ print $2, ($1/4) }' postQCreads.txt > postQCreads2.txt

# count mapped reads for all samples
rm mappedreads.txt
for i in *.sam.counts; do
    awk '{sum += $2} END {print FILENAME"\t"sum}' $i >> mappedreads.txt
done

# join all together
paste <(sort rawreads2.txt) <(sort postQCreads2.txt) <(sort mappedreads.txt) > ../processed/count_totals_newpars.txt

# delete all files in the intermediate directory
rm *
